We do not set the font-size in body and create responsive queries for setting\n   relative font-sizes in the html element. For most users 1rem = 16px. Users\n   can set larger (or smaller) font sizes globally (e.g.: font-size: 150%) and\n   affect all websites. We honor the users intent and do not hardcode any \n   absolute value in html font-size property.\n \n\n## Box sizing\n\nMendeleev sets `box-sizing: border-box` to all elements in the page. This \noption cannot be overridable. However, you can revert some element and all\nof its descendants to the default `box-sizing: content-box` behavior by \nadding the `reset-box-sizing` class to it.\n\n\n## Animations\n\nMost transitions are marked with a global duration. We only blacklist font-size,\nsince it creates sluggish transitions when window size is changed.  \n\n## Resets\n\nAn atomic CSS lib.\n");
